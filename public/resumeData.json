    "bio":"I started my career as an intern at Horizon Wind Energy at Houston, TX. This was the most exciting times where I built a MS Silverlight application that showcased a map powered by ARC GIS for showing wind farms. From there I worked as a Software Engineer in several other companies like E-GuideTV, Zynga, Intuit, Coursera and ServiceNow. I have not worked on the same technology in any of these companies. Blessing or curse that I switched so much but now I see the big picture and I love it",
